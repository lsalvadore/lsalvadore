Welcome to **Lorenzo Salvadore**'s GitHub profile.

I am known on the web with the following profile names:
* **salvadore**, which is my main profile name;
* **lsalvadore**, which is the name of my account on GitHub, as salvadore was already taken;
* **phascolarctos**, which is a name that I used in the past. I might still use it sometimes, in particular in publicly available e-mail addresses.

Main activities:
* **FreeBSD developer**: https://people.freebsd.org/~salvadore/
* Hacker on **TryHackMe**: https://tryhackme.com/p/salvadore
* Hacker on **HackTheBox**: https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/855831

In the languages card below, TeX has been escluded because two of my main projects are big documentation projects that make the TeX percentage raise very high, so that the percentages for all other languages fall down and lose significance.
